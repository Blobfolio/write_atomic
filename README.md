Write Atomic was originally a stripped-down remake of [`tempfile-fast`](https://crates.io/crates/tempfile-fast), but with the `3.4.0` release of [`tempfile`](https://crates.io/crates/tempfile), it has largely been mooted.

(`tempfile` now supports Linux optimizations like `O_TMPFILE` natively.)

That said, one might still enjoy the ergonomic single-shot nature of Write Atomic's `write_file` and `copy_file` methods, as well as their permission/ownership-syncing behaviors, and so it lives on!



## Examples

```rust
// One line is all it takes:
write_atomic::write_file("/path/to/my-file.txt", b"Some data!").unwrap();
```



## Installation

Add `write_atomic` to your `dependencies` in `Cargo.toml`, like:

```
[dependencies]
write_atomic = "0.5.*"
```
